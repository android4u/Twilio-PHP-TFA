Twilio-based Two Factor Authentication


This project is mostly for demonstration purposes on how you might use Twilio
  with an existing authentication system to create a Two Factor Authentication
  system. Fundamentally it's pretty simple in concept and operation.

When you create a user, the user gets an welcome notification via SMS to confirm
  their phone number.

When you attempt to log in, a correct username/password combination results in
  a normal log in. An incorrect combination results in a "denied" message.

If you want to reset your password, you can request the new password to be
  delivered either via Voice or SMS. In a regular usage situation, this would
  be the most logical and safest as the phone number is never exposed to the
  web site user.
